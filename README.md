README: Training and Deployment for Front/Back Image Classification

1. Project Overview

This project involves building a binary classification model to differentiate between "front" and "back" images. The solution is implemented using transfer learning with MobileNetV2, and the trained model is served using FastAPI. The process includes dataset preparation, training pipeline, model serving, and containerization using Docker.

2. Training Process

2.1 Dataset Preparation

The dataset is organized into two categories: front and back.

The data is split into train, val, and test subsets with a ratio of 70:15:15.

Images are resized to dimensions required by the model (224x224 for MobileNetV2).

2.2 Training Pipeline

Preprocessing:

Images are normalized to the range [0, 1].

Data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation) can be applied if necessary.

Model Architecture:

A pre-trained MobileNetV2 model (from ImageNet) is used as the feature extractor.

The final classification layers include:

A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer to reduce feature maps.

Dense layers with ReLU activation.

A sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The base layers of MobileNetV2 are initially frozen.

Training Steps:

Initial training is done with the pre-trained MobileNetV2 layers frozen.

Fine-tuning is performed by unfreezing the deeper layers and training the entire model with a lower learning rate.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are computed to evaluate the model.

Tools and Libraries:

TensorFlow for model training.

Scikit-learn for dataset splitting and evaluation metrics.

Matplotlib for visualizing training progress.

Saving the Model:

The trained model is saved as a .h5 file for deployment.

3. Deployment Process

3.1 FastAPI Application

The FastAPI app exposes a /predict/ endpoint to classify images from URLs.

The app:

Fetches an image from the provided URL using the requests library.

Preprocesses the image to match the model's input requirements.

Uses the trained model to predict the class (front or back) and confidence score.

3.2 Dockerization

A Docker container is built to run the FastAPI app.

Steps to Build and Run the Docker Image

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t front-back-classifier .

Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 front-back-classifier

Test the API using a tool like Postman or curl.

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}'

4. Exploring Other Methods

While MobileNetV2 was chosen for its efficiency and simplicity, alternative approaches could also be considered for better performance:

4.1 YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Overview:

YOLO is an object detection model, but it can also be adapted for classification tasks.

YOLO divides an image into grids and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects.

Advantages:

Real-time performance with high accuracy.

Can be used for multi-object classification if needed.

Use Case:

If the "front" and "back" images include multiple distinguishable objects.

4.2 Faster R-CNN

Overview:

A two-stage object detection model that first generates region proposals and then classifies objects within those regions.

It can be adapted for image classification by treating the entire image as one region.

Advantages:

High accuracy for complex images.

Robust to variations in image content.

Use Case:

If the dataset includes diverse and complex images that require a more detailed feature extraction.

4.3 Vision Transformers (ViT)

Overview:

Vision Transformers split an image into patches and process them as sequences using self-attention mechanisms.

They excel at capturing long-range dependencies in images.

Advantages:

State-of-the-art performance on many image classification benchmarks.

Flexible and scalable for large datasets.

Use Case:

If the dataset is large and computational resources are sufficient.


5. Requirements

Libraries in requirements.txt:

fastapi: To create the API.

uvicorn: To serve the API.

tensorflow: For model training and inference.

numpy, Pillow: For preprocessing.

requests: To fetch images from URLs.

scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas: For training pipeline and visualization.

6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy an image classification model using MobileNetV2 and FastAPI. With enhancements like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or Vision Transformers, the solution can be further optimized for more complex datasets. Containerization using Docker ensures easy deployment and scalability.
